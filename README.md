# Work Samples

This repository contains some examples of projects I worked on while in school. Some are from my undergrad at Guelph, and others from my grad cert program at COGS.

## Projects

### Esri Canada App Challenge 2022
#### Map n' Cheese
This was my team's submission to the Esri Canada App Challenge in 2022. We made a web application to keep people informed during an emergency situation. The app also allows people to report incident locations and to offer aid to their community.

### Observing Suspended Sediment in Lake Erie
##### Suspended_sediment.pdf
This project involved comparing different methods to enhance spatial imagery to better observe the suspended sediment in Lake Erie, Ontario.


### Analyzing Burn Areas in Northern Ontario
##### Burn_areas.pdf
This is a poster which goes over my process for analyzing burn areas in Northern Ontario using band ratios and indices. The analysis was done using PCI Catalyst and ArcGIS Pro.


### Mountain Pine Beetle Spread in Canada
##### MPB_canada.pdf
The project involved using GIS to analyse the future distribution of the mountain pine beetle if the climate continues to warm.


### Demographic Trends in Europe
##### DemographicTrends_EU_1995.pdf
This was an analysis of demographic trends in Europe in 1995 using R.


### Identifying Solar Panel Placement Using LiDAR
##### LiDAR_solarPanels.pdf
For this project, I wrote a Python script to determine the best locations to place solar panels in Lawrencetown, Nova Scotia using LiDAR data.


### Analysis of the Toronto Raptors 2018-2019 Season
##### Toronto_Raptors_analysis.pdf
An exploratory data analysis of the Raptors 2018-2019 season using R.


### Object Based Image Classification
##### OBIA_poster.jpg
A poster showing different land cover classes of Halifax, Nova Scotia, as well as an elevation map, an NDVI and a true colour composite. This classification was done using object based image analysis in PCI Catalyst.


### Affected Land Map
##### AffectedLandMap.pdf
This is a map showing 3 possible options for a proposed pipeline through Wellington County and how they would affect the land and forests around them. This was made while I was doing my undergrad, so there are a few things which I would do differently now. I would probably include a short description of what the Canada Land Index is. I would also change the styling of the cleared land buffer, as it is not apparent how it is now.


### Affected Water Map
##### AffectedWaterMap.pdf
This is a map similar to the Affected Land Map, but showing the streams, lakes, and wetlands that would be affected by the theoretical pipelines. 


### Fires In The City Of Toronto
##### Toronto_fires.pdf
A map showing the location of fire stations and the fire run areas in Toronto, as well as the location of fire incidents in 2018. 


### Stolen Cars from Toronto
##### Toronto_stolenCars.jpg
A choropleth map showing the amount of stolen cars per 10,000 residents by census tracts.
